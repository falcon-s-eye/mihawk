        <p> Let's take a look of the place of the falcon in history <em> The falcon has a place in mythology and religion. Among the ancient Egyptians, it is the god Horus, one of the most powerful and often represented gods in the Egyptian pantheon. Its archetype is probably a lanyard falcon (Falco biarmicus) or a peregrine falcon. Both species were able to play an equal role in the birth of the myth. In connection with the falcon's predatory status, the god Horus is also a god of power, since the crown of Egypt is attributed to him by the gods</em></p>
